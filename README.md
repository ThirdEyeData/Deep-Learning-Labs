# Deeplearning Tutorial Notebooks

This project contains Deep-learning tutorials notebooks from the assignments of course deeplearning.ai in Coursera

## Prerequisites

In order to run these notebooks in your local machine, install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which contains all the required packages required.
Anaconda is an open source distribution and is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. It is industry standard for developing, testing ad training on a single machine.

There are also a few pre-trained model which is required to run a few notebooks, the download links for those files are mentioned below:
* [ResNet50.h5](https://thirdeyebigdata-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/djdas_onthirdeye_com/EYfA1jaIu5xPsTQzj_0CWBkBCAQH9_R-ssAL9SnAnzB0UQ?e=K33vZO)
* [yolo.h5](https://thirdeyebigdata-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/djdas_onthirdeye_com/EbS4VgLf-HtPmi_91Qf_Z4sB7LMq85uzHKzcaQEEEvCG5w?e=CGkQf5)
* [imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat](https://thirdeyebigdata-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/djdas_onthirdeye_com/EXcs66kOWtpFllRDQtT0WdYBS11x5dlt_5_LWoA_QUNWSw?e=YCsHRU)

## Installing

Download the Anaconda Distribution from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install in your local machine. This would install all the required packages and jupyter notebook in your machine.

## Running the notebooks in your local machine:

First git clone the project in your local machine directory.
Next download the the pre-trained models from the link above and save them in the following path:

**ResNet50.h5** -> ```\Deep-Learning Labs\03. Convolutional Neural Networks\13. Residual Networks>```

**yolo.h5** -> ```.\Deep-Learning Labs\03. Convolutional Neural Networks\14. Autonomous driving application Car detection\model_data```

**imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat** -> 
```.\Deep-Learning Labs\03. Convolutional Neural Networks\16. Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer\pretrained-model```
